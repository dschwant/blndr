Save final sim:
https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/8169/using-rigid-body-physics-to-set-objects-initial-positions
1-Select all of the objects involved in the rigid body physics simulation
2-Bake to Keyframes (in 3D View window, hit T, then select Physics > Bake to Keyframes)
3-Still with all the objects selected, open the Graph Editor
4-All the keyframes should be selected already. If not, hit A.
5-Move keyframes back 300 frames (Gx-300).
6-Erase all keyframes (Delete-Enter).
--------
Another way to solve this problem without the need to bake is to use Apply Visual Transform like this:

1-Go to frame 300 and select all the mesh pieces
2-CTRLA -> Visual Transform

Applying Visual Transform will set the Location, Rotation and Scale of all the selected objects to what they are on frame 300.
With this method, you don't need to bake the simulation and you also don't loose the rigid body settings.
